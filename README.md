# Northwind

This is a simple CRUD application for managing the Employees in a standard Northwind database. It is hosted [here](https://svelte-northwind.onrender.com) as quick preview.

The application interfaces with a [REST service hosted via Express in Node.js](https://github.com/bhaeussermann/northwind-api).

It connects to where the API is hosted [here](https://northwind-api.onrender.com/swagger/) by default, but this can be changed in *vite.config.ts* if you're hosting the API yourself.
